*  Description of the program
*******************************************************

This program reads first input seed from user and the calculate using
the formula that were given from book (multiplier * seed + increment) % modulus, and then
using the answer from the first step to plug in the seed for next step and so on until the 
pattern generated will not repeat until 729 different numbers have been produced. 


*******************************************************
*  Source files
*******************************************************

Name:  Point.cpp
  
  This one is to define the function that have declared in Point.h

Name: area.cpp
   define the function of computearea also include point.h.

   
*******************************************************
*  Circumstances of programs
*******************************************************

   The program runs successfully.  
   
   The program was developed and tested on Clion with minGW. 
 It was compiled, run.


*******************************************************
*  How to build and run the program
*******************************************************

1. Using Clion to create a source file and named it as follows.

        Point.cpp
	    area.cpp

       

2. Build the program.

   Base on the question then built the code.
	

3. Run the program by:
   
    Clion with minGW.
