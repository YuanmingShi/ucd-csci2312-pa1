*  Description of the program
*******************************************************

This assignment is to implementation of the class and store the point in 3D. This class also contains the function of distance, semi and then calculate the area.


*******************************************************
*  Source files
*******************************************************

Name:  Point.cpp
  
  This one is to define the function that have declared in Point.h

Name: area.cpp

   define the function of computearea also include point.h.

   
*******************************************************
*  Circumstances of programs
*******************************************************

   The program runs successfully.  
   
   The program was developed and tested on Clion with minGW. 
 It was compiled, run.


*******************************************************
*  How to build and run the program
*******************************************************

1. Using Clion to create a source file and named it as follows.

        Point.cpp
	    area.cpp

       

2. Build the program.

   Base on the question then built the code.
	

3. Run the program by:
   
    Clion with minGW.
